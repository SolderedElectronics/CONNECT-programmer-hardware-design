CONNECT programmer is designed to allow extremely simple programming of boards based on ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers. It contains all the necessary electronics and logic so that programming can be done by plugging USB cable into CONNECT programmer and connecting CONNECT programmer to the programming header. Electronics that take care of timing and signal sequence are also on board, so it puts the ESP uC into bootloader mode.

ESP programming header can be found boards made by Soldered based on ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontrollers that do not have a USB-UART converter, but this programmer can be used for any other ESP32 / ESP8266 board as well.
